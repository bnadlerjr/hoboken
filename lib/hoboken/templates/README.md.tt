## Getting Started

The following pre-requisites are needed to build this project:
* Ruby <%= RUBY_VERSION %>

After cloning this repository, the project can be setup by running the `./bin/setup` script. This script will install dependencies and perform any other required setup tasks.

Once setup is complete, you can start a local development server by running the `./bin/server` script. Additionally, you can start a development console using the `./bin/console` script. The console uses the [racksh](https://github.com/sickill/racksh) gem which exposes a `$rack` variable that can be used to make simulated HTTP requests.

## Configuration
Environment variables are used for project configuration. For local development, the `.env` file is used. Below is a sample `.env` file that contains the minimum required configuration.

```
RACK_ENV=development
```

Here is a table containing all available environment variable configuration options and their descriptions.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Required?</th>
            <th>Default Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>MAX_THREADS</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>The maximum number of threads that a Puma worker process should use</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PORT</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>9292</td>
            <td>Web server port</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>No</td>
            <td>production</td>
            <td>Web server environment (i.e. development, test, production, etc.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SESSION_SECRET</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>None</td>
            <td>Key used for signing and/or encrypting cookies set by the application to maintain session state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>WEB_CONCURRENCY</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>The number of Puma worker processes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

## Development
This project has the following default behavior:

* helpers scripts for common project actions; refer to the `bin` folder
* uses [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) as the default web server
* [erubi](https://github.com/jeremyevans/erubi) for templating; escaping is done by default
* [Rack::Csrf](http://rubygems.org/gems/rack_csrf") is turned on by default
* environment variable support via the [dotenv](http://rubygems.org/gems/dotenv) gem
* Procfile for [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) support; if foreman is not installed uses rackup instead
* code reloading via the [rerun](https://github.com/alexch/rerun) gem is enabled for the development environment
* [pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug") is installed for debugging

## Logging
TODO: Describe how logging is setup (i.e. files, STDOUT, services like Papertrail, DataDog, etc.).

## Deploying
TODO: Describe how to deploy the project (QA, production, CI setup, etc.). Don't forget to describe how project environment variables are set for the various deployment targets.
