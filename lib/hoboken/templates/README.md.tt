## Contributing

### Issues / Roadmap

Use GitHub issues for reporting bug and feature requests.

### Patches / Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull).
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
