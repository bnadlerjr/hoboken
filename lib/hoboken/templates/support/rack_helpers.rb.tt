require_relative 'rack_test_assertions'

# Helpers for running Rack-based tests or specs. Decorates normal Rack methods
# with an optional `:as` parameter. If present, the `rack.session` will
# include the value of the given user's ID, effectively signing them in for
# the request.
#
# Example
# ```
# # Find or create a user. You can name the class anything you'd like, the
# # only requirement is that it responds to a `id` method.
# user = User.new(id: 1) # or User.find, etc.
# get '/', as: user
# ```
#
# The above will add a `current_user` to the `rack.session` with a value of
# the user's ID.
